## Introduction to C Programming

### The Role of a Compiler

**C** is a high-performance, compiled programming language. This means that before running your C program, it must first be translated into machine code that the computer can understand. This translation process is handled by a **compiler**.

A **compiler** is a program that reads your source code (written in C) and converts it into an intermediate form known as **assembly code**. Then, a **linker** combines this code with libraries and resources to produce the final executable program.

In summary, the process involves:
1. **Writing**: You write the source code using C.
2. **Compiling**: The compiler translates the code into assembly or machine code.
3. **Linking**: The linker combines the machine code with other object files and libraries to create an executable program.
4. **Running**: The operating system loads the executable program into memory, and the program is executed.

### The Compilation Process

Here’s an overview of what happens when you compile a C program:

1. **Preprocessing**:
   - The preprocessor handles directives such as `#include`, `#define`, and conditional compilation. It essentially prepares the code by replacing macros and including header files.

2. **Compilation**:
   - The **compiler** takes the preprocessed source code and translates it into **assembly language**. This is a low-level human-readable code that represents machine instructions.

3. **Assembly**:
   - The **assembler** converts the assembly code into **machine code** (binary format), resulting in an object file (`.o` or `.obj`). This file contains the machine code instructions that the computer can execute, but it's not yet a complete program.

4. **Linking**:
   - The **linker** takes the object files and links them with libraries (standard C libraries or custom ones) and other object files to produce an **executable** program (usually with a `.exe` or no extension on Linux systems).

   The linker resolves references to external functions and variables, such as those from the C standard library (like `printf`, `malloc`, etc.).

### From Source Code to Machine Code

- **Source Code**: The code that you write in C (e.g., `program.c`).
- **Object Code**: The result of compiling source code into machine instructions (e.g., `program.o`).
- **Executable Code**: The final program, which the operating system can run (e.g., `program.exe` or `a.out`).

Here’s how you might compile and run a simple C program using the GCC compiler:

```bash
gcc program.c -o program   # Compilation step
./program                 # Run the program
```

## Variables and Data Types

In C, **variables** are used to store data. **Data types** define the kind of data a variable holds, such as integers, floating-point numbers, or characters.

### Example of Variable Declarations:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    // Integer variable
    int age = 25;

    // Float variable
    float price = 19.99;

    // Character variable
    char letter = 'A';

    // Boolean (using int as C doesn't have a built-in bool type)
    int is_active = 1;

    printf("Age: %d, Price: %.2f, Letter: %c\n", age, price, letter);
    return 0;
}
```

### Common Data Types:
- **int**: Integer numbers (e.g., `5`, `42`).
- **float**: Floating-point numbers (e.g., `3.14`, `9.99`).
- **char**: Single characters (e.g., `'a'`, `'A'`).
- **double**: Double-precision floating-point numbers (e.g., `3.141592`).
- **bool (int)**: Boolean values, using `1` for `true` and `0` for `false`.

## Operators

C supports various **operators** used for performing calculations and comparisons. These are divided into different categories:

### Arithmetic Operators

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int x = 10, y = 5;

    printf("%d + %d = %d\n", x, y, x + y);  // Addition
    printf("%d - %d = %d\n", x, y, x - y);  // Subtraction
    printf("%d * %d = %d\n", x, y, x * y);  // Multiplication
    printf("%d / %d = %.2f\n", x, y, (float)x / y);  // Division
    printf("%d %% %d = %d\n", x, y, x % y);  // Modulus (remainder)
    return 0;
}
```

### Comparison Operators

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int x = 10, y = 5;

    printf("%d == %d: %d\n", x, y, x == y);  // Equal to
    printf("%d != %d: %d\n", x, y, x != y);  // Not equal to
    printf("%d > %d: %d\n", x, y, x > y);   // Greater than
    printf("%d < %d: %d\n", x, y, x < y);   // Less than
    return 0;
}
```

### Logical Operators

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int x = 1, y = 0;

    printf("x && y: %d\n", x && y);  // AND
    printf("x || y: %d\n", x || y);  // OR
    printf("!x: %d\n", !x);          // NOT
    return 0;
}
```

## Control Flow

Control flow statements are used to direct the execution of your program based on conditions.

### `if` Statement

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int x = 10;

    if (x > 5) {
        printf("x is greater than 5\n");
    } else if (x == 5) {
        printf("x is equal to 5\n");
    } else {
        printf("x is less than 5\n");
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### `switch` Statement

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int x = 2;

    switch (x) {
        case 1:
            printf("x is 1\n");
            break;
        case 2:
            printf("x is 2\n");
            break;
        case 3:
            printf("x is 3\n");
            break;
        default:
            printf("x is unknown\n");
    }
    return 0;
}
```

## Functions

A **function** is a block of reusable code designed to perform a specific task. Functions help in organizing code and making it modular.

### Defining a Function

```c
#include <stdio.h>

// Function declaration
void greet(char name[]) {
    printf("Hello, %s!\n", name);
}

int main() {
    greet("Alice");
    return 0;
}
```

### Function with Return Value

```c
#include <stdio.h>

// Function with a return type
int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}

int main() {
    int sum = add(3, 4);
    printf("Sum: %d\n", sum);
    return 0;
}
```

---

## Loops

Loops are used to repeatedly execute a block of code.

### `for` Loop

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        printf("i = %d\n", i);
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### `while` Loop

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int

 main() {
    int x = 0;
    while (x < 5) {
        printf("x = %d\n", x);
        x++;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

---

## Arrays and Strings

In C, **arrays** are used to store multiple values in a single variable, and **strings** are arrays of characters.

### Arrays

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int numbers[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        printf("%d\n", numbers[i]);
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### Strings

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    char name[] = "Alice";
    printf("Name: %s\n", name);
    return 0;
}
```

---

## Pointers

A **pointer** is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable.

### Example with Pointers

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int x = 10;
    int *p = &x;  // Pointer to x

    printf("Value of x: %d\n", *p);  // Dereferencing the pointer
    printf("Address of x: %p\n", p);  // Printing the address
    return 0;
}
```

---

## Structures

**Structures** allow you to group different types of variables together under a single name.

### Example of Structure

```c
#include <stdio.h>

// Define a structure
struct Person {
    char name[50];
    int age;
};

int main() {
    struct Person person1 = {"Alice", 30};

    printf("Name: %s, Age: %d\n", person1.name, person1.age);
    return 0;
}
```
